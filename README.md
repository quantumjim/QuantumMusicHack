# Quantum Music Hack

Some things I hacked together while listening to sessions of the [1st International Symposium on Quantum Computing and Musical Creativity](https://iccmr-quantum.github.io/1st_isqcmc/).

See [this notebook](music.ipynb) for the process, or listen to the track [here](https://soundcloud.com/james-wootton-348392631/quantum-twinkle-2021).
